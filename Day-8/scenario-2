all of the resources created by terraform only
everything is good but there is an issue with one resource S3 
one of your collegue logged in and updated lifecycle change manually
terraform will not automatically understand there is a change 
unless you run a terraform plan you don't know there is a drift 
when we run terraform refresh it will update the changes

1. Terraform migration ( using import and then running terraform import command which will create a state file).

- This will import the EC2 instance all details which was created manually.

- Importing EC2 instance to create a state file.


# 2. Terraform drift detection ( if some one manually changed any settings for any resource, then detecting that change is called drift detection).

# There are 2 ways to detect it.

Scenario 1: Use terraform refresh using a cron job. ( terraform refresh, refershes the recents changes which was done manually to the statefile and keeps it updated.

Scenario 2: 

- A) Use audit/activity logs to see who made changes, if its changed by user and resources is managed by TF, then send an alert using lambda/azure functions and notify.

- B) Apply strict IAM rules so that no one can login to console.
